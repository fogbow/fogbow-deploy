# Configuration of ATMOSPHERE production federation membership service

For the ATMOSPHERE project, we keep the list of members updated at 
[this location](https://eubrazilcc-rm.i3m.upv.es/projects/atmosphere/wiki/List_of_XMPP_IDs_of_fogbow_allocation_services_(used_to_configure_the_membership_service)).
Use the content of this file to configure the membership service. Assuming that besides the member that you are
deploying (**myfederation.mycloud.mydomain**), **atm-prod.cloud.lsd.ufcg.edu.br** is the only other member already in the federation, 
then, the *membership.conf* file would look like this:

```bash
$ cat allocation-services.conf
# Required
server_port=8081

# Required
# List of members
members_list=atm-prod.cloud.lsd.ufcg.edu.br, myfederation.mycloud.mydomain
```

After you complete the installation, update 
[the redmine page](https://eubrazilcc-rm.i3m.upv.es/projects/atmosphere/wiki/List_of_XMPP_IDs_of_fogbow_allocation_services_(used_to_configure_the_membership_service)) 
with the the **XMPP ID** of your newly deployed Fogbow site, and inform other members so that they can
update their configuration to include your site in their configuration.
