# Installing a Fogbow node

This tutorial provides an easy way to deploy a Fogbow node to manage resources over multiple cloud providers.

The installation has three main steps: infrastructure setup, where the installation host, and the
deployment hosts are configured; node configuration customization, where several configuration files
are edited to reflect the particularities of the Fogbow node's deployment; and the
actual software installation, which is automated through bash scripts and Ansible recipes.
