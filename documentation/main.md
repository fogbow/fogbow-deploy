# Installing a Fogbow instance

This tutorial provides an easy way to deploy a Fogbow instance to manage resources over multiple cloud providers.

The installation has three main steps: infrastructure setup, where the installation host, and the
deployment hosts are configured; configuration customization, where several configuration files
are edited to reflect the particularities of the Fogbow instance's deployment; and the
actual software installation, which is automated through bash scripts and Ansible recipes.
