# Configuration of Shibboleth on Openstack AAA

This option is suitable for federations where members assume that are in a Shibboleth federated
identity provider. Shibboleth is going to be used for the authentication and authorization of users
at the federation level. Authentic and authorized federation users are mapped to suitable users
at the local cloud before their request are submitted by Fogbow to the underlying cloud. In this
case, we are assuming an Openstack cloud, and the description below is for Version 3 of the
Keystone service used in Openstack clouds. The content of the *aaa.conf* file is the following:

```bash
$ cat aaa.conf
# Required
token_generator_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.tokengenerator.shibboleth.ShibbolethTokenGenerator

# Required
federation_identity_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.identity.shibboleth.ShibbolethIdentityPlugin

# Required
authentication_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.authentication.shibboleth.ShibbolethAuthenticationPlugin

# Required
authorization_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.authorization.DefaultAuthorizationPlugin

# Required
local_user_credentials_mapper_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.mapper.all2one.OpenStackAllToOneMapper
```

With this configuration, all authentic users are allowed to execute all operations, and an all-to-one mapping
is used to map all federation users to a single local user in the cloud. There are two other configuration files
that also need to be edited, to appropriately configure the Shibboleth plugins, as well as the Openstack plugins.

Important: A pre requirement of the Shibboleth scenary is deploy the Shibboleth Authentication Application. 
[Follow this tutorial to deploy this one](https://github.com/fogbow/shibboleth-authentication-application-deploy/blob/master/documentation/1.0-install-shibboleth-auth-app-site.md).

## Shibboleht federation identity plugin configuration

File: aaa-plugins/shibboleth.conf
```bash
$ cat aaa-plugins/shibboleth.conf
# Required
shib_public_key_file_path=
```

```bash
$ cat aaa-plugins/shibboleth.conf
# Required
shib_public_key_file_path=/tmp/shibboleth_authentication_application_public.key
```

## Keystone mapper configuration configuration

File: aaa-plugins/local-user-credentials-mapper/keystone-v3-mapper.conf

```bash
$ aaa-plugins/local-user-credentials-mapper/keystone-v3-mapper.conf
# Required
local_token_credentials_domain=

# Required
local_token_credentials_username=

# Required
local_token_credentials_projectname=

# Required
local_token_credentials_password=
```

Considering the example values assumed in this guide, the content of the *keystone-v3-mapper.conf* file would be:

```bash
$ cat aaa-plugins/keystone-v3-mapper.conf
# Required
local_token_credentials_domain=general

# Required
local_token_credentials_username=fogbow-resources-user

# Required
local_token_credentials_projectname=fogbow-resources

# Required
local_token_credentials_password=userpasswd
```
