# Configuration of LDAP on Openstack AAA

This option is suitable for federations where members assume that each site runs its own LDAP
identity provider. LDAP is going to be used for the authentication and authorization of users
at the federation level. Authentic and authorized federation users are mapped to suitable users
at the local cloud before their request are submitted by Fogbow to the underlying cloud. In this
case, we are assuming an Openstack cloud, and the description below is for Version 3 of the
Keystone service used in Openstack clouds. The content of the *aaa.conf* file is the following:

```bash
$ cat aaa.conf
# Required
token_generator_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.tokengenerator.ldap.LdapTokenGeneratorPlugin

# Required
federation_identity_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.identity.ldap.LdapIdentityPlugin

# Required
authentication_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.authentication.ldap.LdapAuthenticationPlugin

# Required
authorization_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.authorization.DefaultAuthorizationPlugin

# Required
local_user_credentials_mapper_plugin_class=org.fogbowcloud.ras.core.plugins.aaa.mapper.all2one.OpenStackAllToOneMapper
```

With this configuration, all authentic users are allowed to execute all operations, and an all-to-one mapping
is used to map all federation users to a single local user in the cloud. There are two other configuration files
that also need to be edited, to appropriately configure the Ldap plugins, as well as the Openstack plugins.

## LDAP federation identity plugin configuration

File: aaa-plugins/token-generator/ldap-token-generator-plugin.conf

```bash
$ cat aaa-plugins/token-generator/ldap-token-generator-plugin.conf
# Required
ldap_identity_url=

# Required
private_key_path=

# Required
public_key_path=

# Required
ldap_base=

# Required
ldap_encrypt_type=
```

The only properties that need to be filled in are the URL of the LDAP server (let us assume that it is
**ldap://ldap.mydomain:389**), the LDAP base, and the type of the encryption used by the LDAP service
(let as assume that is is **md5**). You will need to talk to the LDAP service administrator to get the
correct values to configure the plugin. Assuming the values mentioned in this guide, the
*ldap-token-generator-plugin.conf* file should look like this:

```bash
$ cat aaa-plugins/token-generator/ldap-token-generator-plugin.conf
# Required
ldap_identity_url=ldap://ldap.mydomain:389

# Required
private_key_path=

# Required
public_key_path=

# Required
ldap_base=dc=mydomain

# Required
ldap_encrypt_type=md5
```

## Keystone mapper configuration configuration

File: aaa-plugins/local-user-credentials-mapper/keystone-v3-mapper.conf

```bash
$ aaa-plugins/local-user-credentials-mapper/keystone-v3-mapper.conf
# Required
local_token_credentials_domain=

# Required
local_token_credentials_username=

# Required
local_token_credentials_projectname=

# Required
local_token_credentials_password=
```

Considering the example values assumed in this guide, the content of the *keystone-v3-mapper.conf* file would be:

```bash
$ cat aaa-plugins/keystone-v3-mapper.conf
# Required
local_token_credentials_domain=general

# Required
local_token_credentials_username=fogbow-resources-user

# Required
local_token_credentials_projectname=fogbow-resources

# Required
local_token_credentials_password=userpasswd
```
