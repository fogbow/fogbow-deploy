## Node configuration customization

Firstly, you need to download the *fogbow-deploy* project:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fogbow/fogbow-deploy.git
```

Then, checkout the appropriate branch (these deployment instructions are for the copacabana version):

```bash
$ cd fogbow-deploy
$ git checkout copacabana
```

Node configuration customization depends on the type of node that you want to deploy:

[Multi-cloud node](multi-cloud.md)

[Federation mode](federation.md)
